  - 🔢 Tech stack: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Sympy, PostgreSQL, Flask, Requests, Render.com

- **🎲 Yahtzee Game [work in progress 👷‍♂️]**  
  Who wouldn't enjoy a nice dice game? You can choose between multiplayer and single mode. What's more, thanks to the applied AI model, you can select dices with your voice!

  _This is a hobby project developed in collaboration with cheerful frontend developer, [@nsoktab](https://github.com/nsoktab). I was responsible for creating the server and implementing the voice recognition model._
